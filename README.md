# Horner-s-algorithm
My math professor gave me the idea to turn this into a program, guess I won't take too long on my homework now.
The program currently only checks if number 1 is a zero of your polynom, I'll later add for the user to input the number they want
to be checked and which other numbers are zeros of the polynom.
