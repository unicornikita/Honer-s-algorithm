# Horner-s-algorithm
My math professor gave me the idea to turn this into a program, guess I won't take too long on my homework now.
The program currently only checks if number 1 is a zero of your polynom, I'll later add for the user to input the number they want
to be checked and which other numbers are zeros of the polynom.


15.3.2019: almost finished, only having trouble with the last nested foor loop. When trying x^2 + 8x + 15, where the zeros should be -5 and -3, but it displays -5 and -5 and 0 (unless breaking the loop as I did)

26.3.2019: the algorithm works when trying x^2 + 8x + 15, when trying other numbers there is no output.
